#' polysf: Strictly feasible representation for a polytope
#'
#' Provide a strictly feasible representation for a polytope with implicit
#' equality constraints, and a sampler on the degenerated polytope. The same functionality
#' for Lasso solutions in a non-uniqueness regime, as a special case of the degenerated polytope,
#' is provided as well.
